* writeNumber.py is code to write to a text file

## Week 7
Week 7 lab is found in week07 directory. There was one lab in week 7. The focus was on regex expressions so some of the lab work was to try out  regex in the search box of visual studio code. The files in this directory contain the following
* access.log - this is from www1 in the tutorial data for splunk which can be dowloaded [here](https://docs.splunk.com/images/Tutorial/tutorialdata.zip)
* anon.py contains code to mask the last two triplets of an ip address in the sample log file (sampleAccess.log). 
* anonIP.txt is the output file for the masked ip in anon.py code
* labquiz.py is the code and answers for the lab quiz in week 7
* regex.py is code to pull out the date segement from the sampleAccess.log file
* sampleAccess.log is the first 6 or so entries in the access.log file from splunk [found here](https://docs.splunk.com/images/Tutorial/tutorialdata.zip)

## Week 8
Week 8 lab is found in week08 directory. There was one lab in week 8. The focus was on plots eg matplotlib. 
* ages.py contains a program that makes a list called ages that has the same number random value as salaries range 21 to 65 and shows a scatter plot of that data with the salaries. Then add a plot of y = x**2 over it
* countries.py contains program that has a list of countries (long) that picks five countries. Some countries should appear in the list more than once. Make a pie chart and a barchart
* extra.py contains program that makes a list called ages that has the same number random value as salaries range 21 to 65 and shows a scatter plot of that data with the salaries. Then add a normal dist plot over it
* prettier-plot.jpg contains output from ages.py
* salaries.py contains a program that makes a list called salaries, that has 10is random numbers from 20k to 80k
* salariesHist.py contains a program that makes a list called salaries, that has 10is random numbers from 20k to 80k and then plots a histogram
* squaredPlot.py contains a program that plots y = x^2

## Week 9
Week 9 is found in week09 directory. There was one lab in week 9. The focus was on pandas

* form.py contains a programme to create a data form with data in it
* grades.csv contains output from form.py
* grades.xlsx contains output from form.py
* readLog.py contains read from an access.log file in to a dataframe - assuming the delimiter is ''. The access log is then cleaned and plotted. 

## Week 10
Week10 is found in week10 directory. The topic is logging. The lab's aim is to create a module that has the fibonacci sequence function i.e. lists the fibonacci sequence of inputed length, with error control that is called from the useFib.py code.  The error controlled module can be found in **myFunctions.py** and the code calling it can be found in **useFib.py**
